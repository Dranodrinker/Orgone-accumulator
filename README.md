# Orgone-accumulator
The Neutron sound orgone accumulator code for DIY and Reatail modules.

THe overclock version will give better sound, it has a higher sample calculation and playback rate.
you must edit boards.txt to allow teensy 144mhz overclock.

no reports of burned teensys from overclocking to 144mhz. it barely gets warm with orgone code (no DMA)
